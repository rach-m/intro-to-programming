# Intro to Programming


## What is Programming


**You Do:**

Spend 5 minutes writing out your understanding of programming. What is it?
What does it mean? Try not to look at the definition below.

---


```
Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. 
These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.

The end goal is to create something: that could mean anything from a web page, or
a piece of software, or even just a pretty picture. That’s why computer programming is often described 
as a mix between art and science; it’s technical and analytical, yet creative at the same time.
```
  -- [Karen McCandless](https://news.codecademy.com/what-is-computer-programming/)


So there are a couple of parts to our answer:

1. Programming is a verb: we're doing something, namely making a program.
1. Programming is about interacting with computers. We are trying to get the computer to do something, after all.
1. Programming is about solving problems.

How do those points stack up against what was in your answer?

### Programming Languages

There are hundreds (if not thousands) of programming languages - some are
general use and versatile while others are extremely specialized. You'll learn
two programming languages in WDI: [Python](https://www.python.org/) and
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). But what
is a programming language? Why are there so many? If programming is solving
problems with programs then how does a programming language fit in?

Programming languages are how we communicate with computers. We can't just say,
"Hey computer, multiple 5 times 9," but we can use a programming language to say
`5 * 9`. Programming languages are how we express our solution to a problem to
our computer and to other developers. We call them *languages* because they are
written, have grammar and syntax, and are used to express ourselves (just like
English or any spoken language).

Each programming language is a little different, sometimes very different, but
the principles of programming are shared across all languages.

## Thinking like a Programmer

This exercise will get you primed to start thinking like a programmer! What does it mean to think like a programmer? Well, being a programmer means taking complex problems, breaking them down in to smaller parts, then writing code to solve each small part. Thinking like a programmer is that process: taking a problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, then solving each part to assemble a final solution.

Read through [this article](https://zellwk.com/blog/think/) on thinking like a programmer! When you finish reading the article, turn to neighbor and discuss the following:

* Why do we need to break a problem down in to smaller problems?
* How do we take a problem and identify the smaller problems we need to solve?
* Once we've solved our smaller problems are we finished? What might come next?
* What might a list of steps be for approaching a problem? (hint: write them down!)



## Programming Terminology & Why You *NEED* To Learn It

Consider a medical analogy:
```
I’m going to use the electric shock that’s a form of medicine if you’re very ill, but can make you sort of ill if you’re fine. Clear! Oh no. He was fine. Now he’s poorly from too much electric.
— That Mitchel and Webb Look
```
Doctors do not discuss diagnoses with each other in simple terms. Medical schools don’t teach in simple terms, either. Medicine is complicated, so they communicate with a complicated set of terminology. Everyone understands the term “broken leg,” but that is too vague for a medical diagnosis. Using precise terminology like “transverse compound fracture of the tibia” allows medical staff and students to communicate accurately.

Programming is not as complex as the human body, but it is still complex. This complexity is why programming has so much terminology. There are lots of concepts, and all of those concepts have names. Just like in medicine, we use terminology to communicate accurately, because simple terms are often too vague.

I’d love to give you: This man shares his three quick tips to understand programming – software developers hate him! But there are no three tips that will fix this problem. You just have to invest time into learning the vocabulary.

## A List of Basic Programming Terms
Here are the definitions for some basic programming terms, with usage examples. These terms are applicable to most programming languages.


- **Algorithm**

    - (noun) a step-by-step procedure to achieve a specific goal. Can be implemented with code.
    - Example: I used the quicksort algorithm to sort the array alphabetically.

- **Argument**

    - (noun) a value that is passed into a function when it is called. Arguments are said to be “passed” into a function, and functions are said to “take” arguments. Also known as a “parameter.”
    - Example: That function takes two arguments.

- **Array**

    - (noun) a type of value that contains a sequence of other values.
    - Example: I put all our names into an array of strings.
- **Assignment**
  - (noun) the act of putting a value into a variable.
  - Example: I assigned the number 22 to the age variable.
- **Brackets**
  - (noun) characters often used to surround text. The different types of brackets are:
    - Parenthesis/parens/round brackets: ( )
    - Curly brackets/braces: { }
    - Angle brackets: < >
    - Square brackets: [ ]
   - The bracket at the beginning is called the “opening” or the “left” bracket. The bracket at the end is called the “closing” or “right” bracket.
   - Example: Your code won’t compile because you forgot a closing bracket.

- **Boolean**
  - need definition

- **Bug**
  - (noun) a mistake in a program.
  - Example: There must be a bug because the output is wrong.

- **Call**
  - (verb) to run the code in a function. Also referred to as “running,” “executing,” or “invoking” a function. For the noun, see function call.
  - Example: I called the ran the function and it returned 42.

- **Comment**
   - (noun) arbitrary text written around code, but which is never run, and is generally ignored by the computer. Used to leave notes and documentation for people who read the code later. Also used to stop code from running (see comment out).
  - Example: I wrote comments in my code so I could understand it later.

- **Comment Out**
  - (verb) to turn code into a comment so that it does not get run.
  - Example: I commented out this line of code, and it doesn’t crash any more.

- **Crash**
  - (verb) to cause a running program to stop due to an error.
  - Example: I tried to divide a number by zero, which made the program crash.

- **Data Structure**
  - (noun) a value that contains other values.
  - Example: Arrays are one kind of data structure.

- **Debug**
  - (verb) to investigate and fix bugs.
  - Example: I spent all day debugging a complicated error.

- **Declaration**
  - (noun) code that declares that something exists – usually a variable, function or a class. A declaration might not fully define the thing it is declaring. E.g. a constant may be declared to exist, without actually defining what it’s value is. Not all programming languages allow for declarations.
  - Example: My code won’t compile because I wrote a function declaration, but I forgot to write the actual function.

- **Execute**
  - (verb) Synonym for run.
  - Example: I can’t execute my program because it won’t compile.

- **Float**
  - (noun) a type of value that represents numbers with fractional parts. Short for “floating-point number”.
  - Example: The value 3.14 is a float.

- **Function**
  - (noun) a piece of code that is not run until it is called. Functions take zero or more arguments. When a function finishes running, it returns a return value back to the code that called it.
  - Example: I wrote a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument, and returns the average.

- **Function Call**
  - (noun) code for calling a function. Function calls specify which function to call, and all of the arguments that the function requires. The result of a function call is a return value. Not all functions have a return value.
  - Example: The function call add(1,2,3) returns the value 6.

- **Implement**
  - (verb) to write all the code to complete something – usually a function or a class.
  - Example: I finished implementing those functions.

- **Integer**
  - (noun) a type of value that represents whole numbers. For fractional numbers, see float.
  - Example: 42 is an integer value.

- **Invoke**
  - (verb) Synonym for call.
  - Example: I invoked the function with the wrong arguments, and it crashed.

- **Iterate**
  - (verb) Synonym for loop.
  - Example: I iterated over all the values in the array.

- **Loop**
  - (noun) a piece of code that runs itself repeatedly. Commonly used to run a piece code for every value in an array. Also known as “iteration”.
  - Example: The code loops until the user types in “quit.”

- **Method**
  - (noun) a function that is attached to an object. Methods belong to, and are defined in, a class. Also known as a “member function.”
  - Example: The length method returns the number of characters in a string object.

- **Nested**
  - (adjective) contained within something like itself. E.g. a nested array is an array that is inside another array.
  - Example: I used a nested loop to loop over a grid – the outer loop for the x coordinate, and the inner loop for the y coordinate.

- **Object**
  - (noun) an unordered collection of related data, in the form of “key: value” pairs
  - Example: I make the enemy move by changing the position instance variable of the enemy object.

- **Object-Oriented**
  - (adjective) designed using objects.
  - Example: Ruby is an object-oriented programming language because all values are objects in Ruby.

- **Parameter**
  - (noun) Synonym for argument.
  - Example: That function takes two parameters.

- **Program**
  - (noun) a full piece of software that is ready to be run.
  - Example: I wrote a program that keeps track of my todo list.

- **Return**
  - (verb) to immediately stop a called function from running, possibly providing a return value. A function automatically returns once all of its code has been run. However, the code in the function definition can force the function to return at any point.
  - Example: If the array is empty, the function returns early without running the rest of its code.

- **Return Value**
  - (noun) the value that results from a completed function call.
  - Example: The return value of the rand function is a random float between 0.0 and 1.0.

- **Run**
  - (verb) to perform the instructions written in code or an executable. Code is a set of instructions, and “running” code is when the computer actually performs those instructions. To “run” a function means to call that function (see call).
  - Example: I wrote a new feature, and ran the code to check that it works.

- **String**
  - (noun) a type of value that represents text. The word “string” derives from the phrase “string of characters.” E.g. The string "cat" is a string (a.k.a. sequence) of the characters ‘c’, ‘a’, and ‘t’.
  - Example: I represented my name as a string in the code.

- **Syntax**
  - (noun) the grammatical rules of a programming language. Every programming language has different syntax. Syntax determines whether code is written correctly or incorrectly, and is enforced by the compiler or interpreter. Code will not compile or run unless the syntax is correct.
  - Example: I forgot to write the brackets, so
I got a syntax error.

- **Value**
  - (noun) a piece of data that can be contained inside a variable. Every value has a type. Values represent information, in a way that code can work upon. Code can:
send and receive values over the internet
save values into files
convert values into different values
etc.
  - Example: My program asks a user for the year they were born, then uses that value to calculate their age.

- **Variable**
  - (noun) a named container for a single value. Variables are not values themselves, they are merely containers for values. Putting a value into a variable is referred to as assignment. Variables are named after the fact that their value can vary – a different value can be assigned to a variable at any time.
  - Example: I assigned the string value "Tom" to the name variable.
